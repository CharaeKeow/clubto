# Club.to - a platform for club in campus to post club activities and events. 
Well I build this to learn [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and Firebase [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/). At first I thought of using MongoDB, but then haven't tried FireStore yet so want to give it a try. My main focus here is to get familiarize with Next so not sure if I'm gonna complete this one.
