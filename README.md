# Club.to - a platform for clubs in campus to post their events and activities.
Well I build this app mainly to learn [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore). I'm kinda lazy to think of any cool idea so I just use this idea which I got from my lecturer. As my main focus here is to master Next, so there's no guarantee that I'll ever complete this (before I jump to other new idea, cliche but yeah). But I will try my best to complete what I have in mind.

## How to Run

1. First, clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/CharaeKeow/clubto.git
```

2. And simply `cd` to the directory and install dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

3. Once it's done, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
